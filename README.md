Problem: Tail-Query to Head-Query Mapping for Search Engines
One of the biggest challenges for commercial search engines is handling tail queries or queries which occur very infrequently. Frequent queries, also known as head queries, are easier to handle largely because their intents are evidenced by abundant click-through data (query logs). Tail queries have little historical data to rely on, which makes them difficult to be learned by ranking algorithms.

The goal of this project is to develop techniques to map tail queries to head queries, such that the performance of the search engine on such queries can be improved.
